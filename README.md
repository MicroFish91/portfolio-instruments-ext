# <img src="resources/core/pi_logo.png" width="35" /> Portfolio Instruments Extension

The Portfolio Instruments VS Code client extension leverages the Portfolio Instruments API, which was built to simplify the management of passive investment portfolios. It enables users to input portfolio data and receive automated rebalancing recommendations based on benchmark criteria, eliminating the need for manual spreadsheet tracking. This API streamlines the process of calculating rebalancing requirements, offering a comprehensive solution for portfolio management. Additionally, users can efficiently query their accounts and assets to gain insights into their holdings across different tax shelters, financial institutions, liquidity levels, and more.

<b>Note</b>: This project is mostly for my personal use, however, you are free to use it as well if you find it useful.
